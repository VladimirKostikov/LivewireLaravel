# Laravel Livewire Project

This repository is created for practicing and showcasing skills with Laravel Livewire, a full-stack framework for Laravel that simplifies building dynamic interfaces without stepping outside the Laravel ecosystem.

## What is Livewire?

[Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) is a Laravel library that allows you to create dynamic, reactive interfaces using Laravel components. Instead of writing JavaScript, you can use PHP and Blade templates to build interactive UIs.

Livewire offers a simple and powerful way to build modern, reactive interfaces in Laravel without the complexity of JavaScript frameworks.

## Features

- **Real-time UI updates:** Handle user interactions like clicks, inputs, etc., directly in PHP.
- **Component-based:** Break your interface down into small, reusable components.
- **Zero JavaScript required:** Although you can integrate JavaScript when necessary, most interactions can be handled with PHP alone.
- **Easily testable:** Write tests for your components just like you would for any other Laravel application.

## Installation

To get started with Laravel Livewire, you need to install the package via Composer.

```bash
composer require livewire/livewire
